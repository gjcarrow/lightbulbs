# Html Skeleton Framework with Gulp and jshint

This is an example  of a Html Skeleton Framework with Grunt and jshint. I have incorporated jshint file as well as Gulp Sass/babelify/browserify/minification of js and  css and well as livereload.

<h1>Instructions</h1>

You need node and npm and http-server installed globally to run this framework.

<h2>windows/linux/os</h2>
```

https://nodejs.org/  follow simple instructions to download nodejs and npm together

sudo npm install -g http-server

```

<h2>Install</h2>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/escapeimagery/html-framework.git
$ cd html-framework-master
$ npm install

```

<h2>Start Server</h2>

```
open terminal at folder root
In a new Terminal type: http-server
This will print running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
copy and paste this address into your browser
N.B This will open and run ./public files

```

<p>Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the example in action</p>

```
Open a new  terminal at root of file
run the gulp command
This will start es6 babelify and will start watch files for sass/js/and minification 
In browser enable livereload in chrome to see changes live as you alter your css and js files.

```
